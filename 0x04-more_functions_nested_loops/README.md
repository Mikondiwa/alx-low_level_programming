# More functions, more nested loops
 
- A project during my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-2022/), a course offered by [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/). 

## Technologies 

- Files written in ```vi```, ```vim```, and ```emacs``` editors. 
- C files compiled using ```gcc 9.4.0```.
- C files wriiten according to the betty coding style.
- Files tested on ```Ubuntu 20.04``` LTS using ```gcc```.
